# Introduction

**ClinKit** is an integrated R package designed to transform cleaned clinical datasets directly into publication-ready figures and statistical outputs, while preserving access to raw analysis objects for complete methodological transparency and customization. It is tailored for clinical research workflows, providing a one-stop solution for routine statistical analysis and reporting.

# Installation

You can install the development version of ClinKit from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LeafLight/ClinKit")
```

# Example Data

For demonstration, we will use a simulated dataset:

```r
library(ClinKit)
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 50),
  age = rnorm(100, 60, 10),
  gender = sample(c("Male", "Female"), 100, replace = TRUE),
  outcome = rbinom(100, 1, 0.4)
)
head(data)
```

# Baseline Table Generation

Generate a baseline characteristics table with automatic test selection:

```r
result <- make_baseline_table(data, group_var = "group")
print(result$summary)
# Export to Word
gtsummary::as_flextable(result$summary) |> flextable::save_as_docx(path = "baseline_table.docx")
```

# Regression Analysis

## Univariate Logistic Regression

```r
uni_res <- run_univariate_logistic_regression(data, outcome = "outcome", predictors = c("age", "gender"))
print(uni_res$summary)
```

## Multivariable Logistic Regression

```r
multi_res <- run_multivariable_logistic_regression(data, outcome = "outcome", predictors = c("age", "gender"), covariates = c("group"))
print(multi_res$summary)
```

# Visualization

## Scatter Plot with Linear Regression

```r
scatter_lm(data, x = "age", y = "outcome")
```

## Forest Plot

```r
# Example: subgroup_forest
# (Assume you have a suitable regression result)
# subgroup_forest(model_result, subgroup_var = "gender")
```

# Specialized Analyses

## High/Low Group Analysis

```r
# highlow_analysis(data, outcome = "outcome", exposure1 = "age", exposure2 = "group")
```

## Quartile-Based Analysis

```r
# quartile_logistic_analysis(data, outcome = "outcome", predictor = "age")
```

# ROC Curve Analysis

```r
# roc_analysis(data, outcome = "outcome", predictors = c("age", "group"))
```

# Exporting Results

- Tables can be exported to Word (`.docx`) or CSV.
- Figures can be saved as PNG, PDF, or SVG.

# Advanced Usage

- All functions return raw analysis objects for further customization.
- Supports integration with tidyverse workflows.
- Publication-ready outputs with minimal code.

# Conclusion

ClinKit streamlines the process of clinical data analysis and reporting in R, making it accessible, reproducible, and publication-ready. For more details, visit the [ClinKit documentation website](https://leaflight.github.io/ClinKit/).
