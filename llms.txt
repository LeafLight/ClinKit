# ClinKit

ClinKit is an integrated R package designed to transform cleaned
clinical datasets directly into publication-ready figures and
statistical outputs, while preserving access to raw analysis objects for
complete methodological transparency and customization.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ClinKit from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LeafLight/ClinKit")
```

## Example Usage

Below is a minimal example using built-in or example data:

``` r
library(ClinKit)
# Example: Generate a baseline table
data <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 50),
  age = rnorm(100, 60, 10),
  gender = sample(c("Male", "Female"), 100, replace = TRUE)
)
result <- make_baseline_table(data, group_var = "group")
print(result$summary)
# Export to Word
gtsummary::as_flextable(result$summary) |> flextable::save_as_docx(path = "baseline_table.docx")
```

## Core Analytical Modules

- **make_baseline_table()**: Automated baseline characteristic tables
  with intelligent test selection. Wraps gtsummary::tbl_summary() with
  built-in normality testing to automatically choose appropriate
  parametric or non-parametric tests, exporting directly to formatted
  Word documents.
- **Regression Analysis Suite**: Comprehensive modeling with progressive
  adjustment:
  - run_univariate_logistic_regression(): Single predictor analysis
  - run_multivariable_logistic_regression(): Sequential multivariable
    models (Model 1-4) with incremental covariate adjustment
  - run_multivariable_multinomial_logistic_regression(): Multi-category
    outcome analysis
- **Visualization Tools**:
  - scatter_lm(): Clean scatter plots with linear regression
  - scatter_lm_marginal(): Enhanced versions with marginal distributions
  - subgroup_forest(): Publication-ready forest plots with 4 built-in
    themes and comprehensive p-value reporting
- **Specialized Analytical Methods**:
  - highlow_analysis(): Variable interaction analysis with intuitive
    high/low grouping
  - quartile_logistic_analysis(), quartile_multinomial_analysis():
    Streamlined quartile-based analysis (Q1-Q4) for continuous
    predictors
  - roc_analysis(): ROC curve visualization with tidy DeLong test
    results

## Key Advantages

- Progressive Modeling: Sequential multivariable regression with
  incremental covariate adjustment (Models 1-4)
- Reproducible Research: All functions return raw analysis objects
  alongside formatted outputs
- Methodological Rigor: Automated statistical appropriateness checks
- Publication-Ready: Direct export to journal-compatible formats
- Clinical Focus: Specialized methods for common clinical research
  scenarios

## Dependencies

ClinKit depends on several R packages, including `gtsummary`,
`flextable`, `ggplot2`, and others. All dependencies will be installed
automatically.

## Example Data

You can use your own cleaned clinical dataset, or refer to the example
in the usage section above.
